They don't do the same thing. 

In the first program, x is incremented each time , since it's definite outside the times method's do block. So at the end, X is 3.

In the second program, x disappears at the end of each iteration, since it's not defined outside of the block. So at the end, you'll get an error message saying that x is undefined.

Testing this hypothesis: yup.
